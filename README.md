The ultimate objective of the proposal is to build a robot which can guide unskilled workers through the process of 
choosing a crop for plantation to maintain the optimum condition  for the crops throughout its lifespan . 



Main Research questions

Wrong decisions made by humans in agriculture has made agriculture as an industry to became less and less profitable.
The highlighted area in this case is deciding a plant to grow in a particular place and keeping the optimal condition
of the environment throughout the lifespan of the crops. few generations ago agricultural decisions which were made by 
humans were accurate because the data passed through the generations. but in modern times passing professions generation 
by generations is rarely happens. that leads to information to not pass-through generations as a result the collective
decisions humans made in agriculture became less accurate. once the decision is made in agriculture it’s impossible to 
change that in short period of time and the decisions will result in profit or loss for a significant amount of time.
one of the biggest decision-making points in agriculture is to choose a crop to grow. as mentioned, this along can make
the plantation profitable or a loss this require carefully analysing the environment including soil, water weather, 
Longitude, and latitude and many more. once the decision is made maintaining the conditions requires throughout the 
lifespan of the crop is essential. this requires analysing deferent propeties

Choosing a crop for a cultivation is one of the most critical decisions. the results that decision results in years of 
financial loss or a revenue. but in recent time there are ricing number of incidents which correct choices weren’t made 
Agricultural decisions made by humans few generations ago were accurate because data was passed down through the
generations with the professions However, in current times, professions are rarely handed from one generation to generation.
As a result, information does not pass down over generations, and collective agricultural decisions become less reliable.
In agriculture, once a decision is made, it is impossible to reverse it in a short period of time, and the decisions will
result in profit or loss for a long time.Choosing a crop to grow is one of the most important decisions in agriculture.
As previously stated, this factor can determine whether the plantation is profitable or not. This necessitates a thorough
examination of the environment, which includes soil, water, weather, longitude, latitude, air, height, angles, and other
factors. Once a decision has been made, it is also necessary to maintain the required circumstances throughout the crop’s 
lifecycle. This necessitates a continuous analysis of various attributes and cross-referencing them with the needed condition.
It takes time for humans to perform this, and it is costly to use human labor. Hundreds of samples are required to obtain 
correct results and making decisions without accurate data leads to poor decisions. Furthermore, the prediction model needs 
to consider more than 100 crops to generate the prediction which will be accurate in the diverse range of locations. 
ultimately this study proposes a fully automated plant suggestion model/system which can be utilized by anyone with or 
without the skilled experience or knowledge about crops or agriculture.

    The major goal of installing a plant recommendation system is to assist untrained agricultural workers in making informed 
    judgments during the initial stages of cultivation. As previously stated, there are an increasing number of poor agricultural 
    decisions [6] that result in a price premium and a lack of access to nutritious food. As a result, the adoption of a plant
    suggestion system aims to reduce the frequency of bad agricultural decisions. Because incorrect judgments made early in the
    cultivation process can result in long-term financial losses, the proposed approach can help to minimize these unneeded losses 
    by benefiting farmers or agriculture-based businesses financially. End-users, or agricultural product consumers, will profit 
    from lower food costs, and, most importantly, those in nations with low GDP per capita will have access to a healthy diet.
    Crop recommendation systems will benefit with increased life expectancy in low-income countries, which are currently 5-15
    years behind developed countries [8] after some time to have extended period of healthy diet [8] . To fulfil these objectives
    there are few products and systems in place but in order to generate accurate predictions or recommendation it’s necessary to
    choose from a relatively large number of crop pool in this scenario crops. And have extremely accurate data inputs. these 2 key 
    factors are the once which directly impacts the accuracy of the program
